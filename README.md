## Purpose of this Research
The primary goal behind this project was to document more bacterial species that can synthesize proteins similar to beef. These bacteria samples were taken from several volunteer's belly buttons.
The visualizations in the link below show the bacteria types and the washing frequencies for a given participant. These visualizations were creating using javascript as the primary programming language.
